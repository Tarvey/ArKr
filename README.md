# ArKr (Argonium Kryptonide)
This is an ongoing project for my GNU/Linux distribution known as Krypton.

If you don't want to compile then you can look at the Actions tab.
## Compiling
You are a dingus. Come on, just compile the special file named "arkr.cpp" using g++.

Currently the only supported compiler is g++, but if you want to use another one, then be aware that there might be some bugs.
